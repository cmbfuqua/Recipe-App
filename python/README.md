# Recipe-App
This is a recipe app that I have thought about for a long time and I am wanting to start building it out. This is a side project and will probably take a long time
## General Summary
This app mainly has 2 different paths. The user schema and the recipe book schema. 
#### Users
The user schema is also the heirarchy for permissions. 
- USER: The basic priveldges, add, remove, and edit recipes in their own recipe book. 
- ADMIN: Can admit/remove people to the 'Family Group' except other admins, delete recipes from other recipe books
- OWNER: The creator of the 'Family Group' can remove people, including admins.
#### Recipe Book
- Each account can have 1 Recipe Book
-   Each Book can have different types of food EX: Salads, Bread, main dish, pastas
- You can either share the whole recipe book or you can share a specific recipe
